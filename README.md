# Reef

Interactive visualization tool of N=4.038 reef sounds (random subset)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marathomas/coati_feeding_viz.git/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2F04_coati_feeding_viz_tool.ipynb)

## About

Sounds are color-coded by HDBSCAN cluster labels.


## How to use the tool


* Right-click on the "launch binder" badge right above this section and select "open in another tab" (else the tool will load in this window). 

* Wait until the app is built (this can take from a few seconds up to 5min if you're doing it for the first time), then initialize the tool by moving your mouse over the 3D plot. 

* When you hover over datapoints with your mouse, you'll be able to see some more details.
* In the lower left corner, you can see a spectrogram of the respective call. 
* Click on a datapoint to hear the sound.
* Click on call groups in the legend to let them disappear/appear
* If you remain inactive for a longer period of time (10min or so?), the tool won't be reactive anymore, so you need to reload it.

## Troubleshooting

If the build takes too long (>5min) or functionalities in the tool are missing, close the window and please re-click the badge. Building the app a second time usually does the trick.
